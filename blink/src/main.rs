// Conceptually, this is our program "entry point". It's the first thing the microcontroller will
// execute when it (re)boots. (As far as the linker is concerned the entry point must be named
// `start` (by default; it can have a different name). That's why this function is `pub`lic, named
// `start` and is marked as `#[no_mangle]`.)
//
// Returning from this function is undefined because there is nothing to return to! To statically
// forbid returning from this function, we mark it as divergent, hence the `fn() -> !` signature.

// function body empty for now.
